# Clone and Use üìã

- The website is completely built on `Spring Boot` framework of `Java` and that's why we need `Spring/SpringBoot` setup.
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
- Clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhranil08/shoppingBackend.git
  ```
  This will clone the whole repository in your system.
  
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can start by running the individual services.
- Change PORT number in application.properties file to use your own. Ex : local URL - http://localhost:3000/ , when PORT number : 3000
